-Main reasons
    - Controll redundancy
    - Data sharing
    - Data Independency
    - Security
    - Backup and failure restoration
    - Force integrity restriction
    - Increasing productivity level
    - Flexbility and standardization
    
-Where do we find them
    - Almost everywhere

-Relational database
-NoSQL database
-Data Store (Big data)

- Data is stored in entities called Tables where columns are fields and rows
are the value of data

- Theory of the sets - Relational algebra
- Entity (table) - Company , People,
- Atributes - Fields, Columns,
- Registers - Rows, Tuples,
- Primary Key - Allow us to distinguish each registered row
- Foreign Key - When a primary key migrates to a different table to stabilish a
relation and allow us to identify a record

"""
Aula 133
NoSQL Databases
Allow more scalable architecture than SQL
- Documents > Millions of Documents
- Graph > Social media, connections and interconnections
- Key-value > Data stored in dictionary shape (key - value)
- Wide-Column > queries are based on keys
